# CEID_Big_Data_Analytics

University project for Databases II course, team with @andreas-tsal.

We worked with Apache Hadoop, Apache HBASE and Apache Phoenix.

We populated our database with data from csv files and created SQL queries in order to extract specific data based on project's tasks.

In order to make these queries more optimal we used secondary indexes.

The results from all queries were exported to csv files.
